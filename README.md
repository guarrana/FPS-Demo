# FPS-Demo

A first person shooter/platformer coded in C# using the Unity 3D engine/framework. Textures and AI Models were created in Photoshop and Blender, and all music/sound is original and were recorded in Ableton Live using live instruments and [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/).

Use the launchpads to jump from platform to platform through space, while finding weapons, avoiding obstacles and fighting enemies.
