# FPS-Demo

A first person shooter/platformer coded in C# using Unity 3D. The game employs a self-coded raycaster (to avoid using Unity's wonky one) for the shooting's collision detection and uses A* for AI pathfinding. Textures and models were created in Photoshop and Blender, and all music and sounds are original and were recorded with Ableton Live using various live instruments and [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/).

# Instructions

Use the launchpads to jump from platform to platform through space (while finding weapons, avoiding obstacles, and fighting enemies) to ultimately get to the portal to the next zone.
