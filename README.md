# FPS-Demo

A first person shooter/platformer coded in C# using Unity 3D. Textures and models were created in Photoshop and Blender, and all music and sounds are original and were recorded in Ableton Live using live instruments and [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/).

Check out the project [here](http://namlani.me) for a demo video and to try the game itself.

# Synopsis

Use the launchpads to jump from platform to platform through space (while finding weapons, avoiding obstacles, and fighting enemies) to ultimately get to the portal to the next zone.
